#Project: Binary Search Trees

A basic binary search trees.
The app returns the input of an array as a binary search form.

1. Node class has an attribute for the data it stores as well as its left and right children.
2. Tree class accepts an array when initialized. The Tree class has root attribute which uses the return value of buildTree.
3. BuildTree function takes an array of data (e.g. [1, 7, 4, 23, 8, 9, 4, 3, 5, 7, 9, 67, 6345, 324]) and turns it into a balanced binary tree full of Node objects.
